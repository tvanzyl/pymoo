    "DAS-CMOP is a constrained multi-objective test suite with tunable constraints <cite data-cite=\"dascmop\"></cite>. The constraints are tuned using a difficulty triplet: $(\\eta, \\zeta, \\gamma)$, with $\\eta, \\zeta, \\gamma \\in [0, 1]$. The triplet allows to adjust the diversity, the feasibility and the convergence hardness respectively.\n",
